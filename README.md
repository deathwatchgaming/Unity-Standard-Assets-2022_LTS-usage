Unity Standard Assets: for (2022_LTS) usages
____________________________________________

Unity took down their Standard Assets a good while ago. As such I simply opted to host them here in this repository, for anyone who wants and or needs them. 

Note: The reason for such is that upon observations that so many books, tutorials and instructions are often reliant on said Standard Assets and thus with observing that with the removal of such often relied upon assets, such circumstances often nullified many such tutorials / instructions in this present day and that prompted me to say: "well, you know with a few minor edits these assets are primarily still viable and such tutorials / instructions / books are still viable using such thus a win win to provide a repo to be able to once again have access to such assets."
